# glfz

A friendly GLFW wrapper for Zig, based on the same approach as [zgl]: incrementally developed, with an object-oriented API.
Each type in GLFW has an equivalent Zig type, with functions defined on that type.
Functions and types are added on-demand, allowing better quality control and ensuring everything is properly tested.
